    Initialized BaSiCPy illumination correction task
    
    This task prepares a parallelization list of all zarr_urls that need to be
    used to perform illumination correction with BaSiCPy.

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        n_images: Number of images to use to calculate BaSiCPy model.
        compute_per_well: If True, calculate illumination profiles per well.
            This can be useful if your experiment contains different stainings
            in each well (e.g., different antibodies with varying intensity
            ranges). Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
