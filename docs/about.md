# Apricot BIO

[Apricot BIO](https://www.apricot-bio.com) is a spin-off company from the University of Zurich and was founded in 2022. Apricot BIO aims to offer a personalized ex-vivo drug response profiling service for cancer patients. Uniquely, Apricot BIO measures the single-cell drug response with a multivariate biomarker panel with an immunofluorescence based, multiplexed imaging technique (4i).

Apricot BIO adapted Fractal as a platform for processing high-throughput imaging data. The APx Fractal Task Collection contains Fractal tasks that were developed to automate our workflows on Fractal. The APx Fractal Task Collection is developed and maintained by [Adrian Tschan](https://github.com/adrtsc).
