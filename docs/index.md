# APx Fractal Task Collection

The APx Fractal Task Collection is mainainted by [Apricot Therapeutics AG](https://apricotx.com/), Switzerland. This is
a collection of tasks intended to be used in combination with
the [Fractal Analytics Platform](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform) maintained by
the [BioVisionCenter Zurich](https://www.biovisioncenter.uzh.ch/en.html) (co-founded by the Friedrich Miescher Institute
and the University of Zurich). The tasks in this collection are focused on extending Fractal's capabilities of
processing 2D image data, with a special focus on multiplexed 2D image data. Most tasks work with 3D image data, but
they have not specifically been developed for this scenario.
