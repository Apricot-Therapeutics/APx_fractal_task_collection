    Initializes ashlar stitching and registration task

    This task prepares a parallelization list of all zarr_urls that need to be
    used to perform ashlar stitching and registration.

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
