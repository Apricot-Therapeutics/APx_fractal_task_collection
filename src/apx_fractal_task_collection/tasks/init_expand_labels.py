    Initialized secondary segmentation task


    This task prepares a parallelization list of all zarr_urls that need to be
    used to perform expansion of a label image.

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        label_name: Name of the label image that contains the objects
            to bee expanded. Needs to exist in OME-Zarr file.
        output_label_image_name: Name of the zarr image that will
            contain the expanded label image. Defaults to "0".
            In case you saved, for example, illumination corrected images in
            the same zarr without overwriting the original images, you can
            specify a different name here (e.g. "0_illum_corrected").

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
