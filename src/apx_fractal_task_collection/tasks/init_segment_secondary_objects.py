    Initialized secondary segmentation task

    Criteria:
    - Works for multiplexing & non-multiplexing
    - 

    Option 1:
    Ask user for path for output_label_image_name => defaults tricky, but fully flexible
    Better: Optional

    Option 2:
    Always put output label in same image as label_image_name => downside: Confusing why label would go there

    Option 3:
    Always put output label in same image as channel => downside: Confusing why label would go there

    Option 4:
    Optional acquisition parameter, used only in multiplexing case, determines where output image goes
    => overkill for the moment

    
    This task prepares a parallelization list of all zarr_urls that need to be
    used to perform secondary segmentation based on a channel image and
    a label image.

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        label_name: Name of the label image that contains the seeds.
            Needs to exist in OME-Zarr file.
        channel_label: Label of the intensity image used for watershed.
            Needs to exist in OME-Zarr file.
        mask: label image to use as mask. Only areas where the mask is
            non-zero will be considered for the watershed.
        output_label_image_name: Name of the zarr image that will
            contain the secondary segmentation. Defaults to "0".
            In case you saved, for example, illumination corrected images in
            the same zarr without overwriting the original images, you can
            specify a different name here (e.g. "0_illum_corrected").

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
